# Scratchpad

Welcome to the **chaitanyamaili/scratchpad** repository! This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and collection of various resources, including code snippets, experiments, configurations, and development notes. The goal is to provide a quick reference and workspace for ongoing development and experimentation.

## Overview

This repository is a work-in-progress, designed to capture quick experiments, technical investigations, and small projects related to software development, infrastructure, and other engineering efforts. It functions as a playground for trying out ideas, sharing technical knowledge, and experimenting with tools, technologies, and configurations.

It may include:
- Code snippets for various programming languages.
- Infrastructure-as-Code templates (e.g., Kubernetes YAML, Terraform, Ansible).
- Notes on debugging or performance tuning.
- Configuration files and environment setups.
- Proof-of-concept implementations.
- Reference materials like `HOW-TOs` or cheat sheets.

**Note**: The content here is often rough and may not adhere to best practices. It is used for personal experimentation and rapid prototyping.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories based on the type of content. Here’s a typical structure:

```bash
.
├── code-snippets/       # Short, self-contained code samples for various languages
├── configs/             # Configuration files for different environments (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
├── docs/                # Technical documentation, notes, and references
├── experiments/         # Prototypes and experimental code
├── scripts/             # Utility scripts for automation and dev tooling
├── tools/               # Custom development tools or utilities
└── README.md            # This file
```

### Folder Breakdown:
- **code-snippets/**: Contains small code examples or reusable snippets.
- **configs/**: Stores configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON, INI, etc.) for various environments.
- **docs/**: Technical notes, architecture designs, debugging notes, or guides.
- **experiments/**: Proof-of-concept projects, quick tests, or throwaway code for exploring new ideas.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts that help automate tasks, build processes, or manage infrastructure.
- **tools/**: Custom utilities, helpers, or mini-tools developed for specific tasks.

## Usage

This repository is designed to be used as a technical scratchpad, meaning the code here may not always be production-ready or fully documented. However, if you are interested in reusing code, follow the instructions in the individual files or directories.

### Examples:

#### 1. Running a Code Snippet
Each code snippet typically has its own folder or file. To run a snippet, simply navigate to the corresponding language directory and execute it. For example:

```bash
# Navigate to a code snippet directory (e.g., Python)
cd code-snippets/python/

# Run the Python script
python3 example.py
```

#### 2. Using Configuration Files
If you’re using configuration files (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Compose), you can copy and modify them as needed for your projects.

```bash
# Applying a Kubernetes config
kubectl apply -f configs/k8s/my-service.yaml
```

#### 3. Experimenting with Prototypes
Some experimental code may be rough and unpolished. Feel free to modify and experiment with it further to fit your needs.

```bash
# Navigate to the experiment directory
cd experiments/feature-x/

# Run the experiment
go run main.go
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you would like to add something to this scratchpad.

### Guidelines
- Keep the content lightweight and modular (e.g., one folder or file per concept/experiment).
- Add a brief explanation to any new code, script, or config, even if it's just a comment at the top of the file.
- Be mindful of sensitive information. Avoid committing credentials or other private data.
